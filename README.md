This README is for the SAP class, testing Git.

Git helps with Agile methodology becuase it keeps all people working within the project updated at all times. Any code changed within the program can be pushed to git allowing the people involved in the project to see the most up to date code in realtime. It helps prevent anyone working on code that is no longer up to date, therefore preventing bugs that may result from such a situation.
